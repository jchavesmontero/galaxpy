CONTENT OF THE FOLDER
---------------------

This folder contains all the star formation histories (SFHs) used to generate galaxy colors in Chaves-Montero et al. 2019. SFHs drawn from UniverseMachine and IllustrisTNG are located in "umachine_sfh.npy" and "illustris_sfh.npy", respectively.



We include four files,


numpy arrays, read using np.load

nsnap: number of snapshots
nobj: number of galaxies, 1000
nmass: different halo masses, 4. Their values are 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13 Msun/h for UM and 11.4, 11.8, 12.3, and 12.8 Msun/h for TNG.
ntype: 0 for star-forming galaxies, 1 for quenched galaxies.
