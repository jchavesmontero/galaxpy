galaxevpl extract individual spectra

filters in filterfrm.res
build_filterbin file to binary (filterbin.res, list in filters.log)
seefilter to extract response function (numbers in filters.log)
new filter response functions can be appended to filterfrm.res (two columns, lambda in A and response in second). Before new filter, put #. filter description in the third character of that line.

csp_galaxev computes the spectral evolution of composite stellar populations (eq. 1 BC03). 
dust according to Charlot & Fall (200). (see \S6 and Eq.6 BC03)
option 0 (SSP) for the SFH does not produce a convolution. I will produce magnitude and colors through the filters in use (and dust)
name_sed.f to output colors? do i need this?
mass normalization to 1 Msun at t=0 (SFR produces 1 solar mass at infinity). everything can be scaled a posteriory

add_bursts combine two bursts of SF (output files as input files). The mas is NOT normalized to 1 Msun

downgrade_resolution only from 3300 to 9300 A (rebin spectra). Do I need this?

cmev compute the redshift dependence of galaxy magnitudes in filters selected by the user from their sequential numbers in filters.log.
the cosmological model and age of the galaxy today can be specified
fmag program, zmag example

template directory contains the 30 templates used by Tremonti to fit continua and measure emission line fluxes in SDSS
